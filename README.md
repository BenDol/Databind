# Databind [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BenDol/Databind.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BenDol/Databind)

Firstly this library has been forked from [Hexa Tools](https://github.com/ltearno/hexa.tools), the reason for this is that the original databinding library was too heavy and lacked some flexibility that I needed (Also made many bug fixes). So credits to @ltearno for majority of this projects orginial functionality.
