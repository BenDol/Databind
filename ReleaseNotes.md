# Hexa Tools release notes

## Hexa Binding v1.3

- confirmation : parametrized types have bug with APT, so it is not possible to use the @Observable annotation on parametrized types for the moment. This might be fixed in a future JDK.

## Hexa CSS v1.3

- added bindings for PureCss, BassCss, Foundation, FontAwesome.
